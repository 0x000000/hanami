- CLI: `hanami db console`. It starts a database REPL.
- Full featured HTML5 markup generator for views (Eg. `html.div { p "Hello World" }`)
- Routing helpers in views and templates (Eg. `routes.home_path`).

- `hanami new .` to generate a Hanami application for an existing code base (Eg. a gem that needs a web UI).

## v0.2.0 - 2014-12-23

- Allow to configure multiple applications and handle Hanami environments accordingly.
- Allow to configure middleware stack, routes, database mapping and adapter for each application.
- Show a welcome page with instructions for new generated apps.
- CLI: `hanami routes`. It prints all the routes available for all the applications.
- CLI: `hanami new`. It generates a new application which can run multiple Hanami applications (_Container_ architecture).
